Predicting Hospital Readmissions for Diabetes Patients

Problem Statement and Objective

Definition:Hospital readmission occurs when a discharged patient is readmitted within a specific time frame, negatively impacting hospital quality metrics and increasing care costs.

Program Context:The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) established the Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program to enhance care quality and reduce costs by penalizing hospitals with high readmission rates for specific conditions.

Diabetes Impact:Although diabetes is not yet penalized under this program, U.S. hospitals incurred over $41 billion in costs for 30-day diabetes-related readmissions in 2011. Effective prediction of these readmissions can help reduce costs and improve patient care.

Goals:

Identify factors strongly predicting hospital readmission in diabetic patients.

Evaluate the predictive accuracy of hospital readmissions using a limited feature set.

Methodology

Data Preparation and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Extensive time was spent on preparing and exploring the dataset due to its inherent imbalance, which is common in real-world datasets.

Data type mismatches were identified and corrected.

Various imputation techniques and feature engineering approaches were employed to ensure high data quality.

Data Visualization

Approximately 10 insightful graphs were created to analyze and understand the data distributions, trends, and potential relationships among features.

Models Used

Logistic RegressionA baseline model for binary classification tasks.

Decision TreeProvides interpretable results and captures non-linear relationships.

Random ForestAn ensemble model that enhances prediction accuracy by combining multiple decision trees.

Addressing Data Imbalance

The Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) was applied to mitigate the effects of dataset imbalance and ensure robust model training.

Results and Insights

Feature Importance: Key factors influencing hospital readmission rates were identified, providing actionable insights for healthcare providers.

Model Performance: Predictive accuracy varied across models, with ensemble methods like Random Forest performing better on the imbalanced dataset.

Impact: The project highlights the potential for predictive analytics to reduce costs and improve care quality by focusing on diabetes-related readmissions.

Technologies and Tools

Programming Languages: Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
